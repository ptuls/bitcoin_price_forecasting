# Bitcoin Price Forecasting

**Welcome to Bitcoin Price Forecasting!**

In this repository, we explore techniques to forecast Bitcoin prices. This is mostly an exercise in time series prediction.

In our example, we use [Facebook's Prophet ])(https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to forecast Bitcoin's future price. Along the way, we use additional information about the Bitcoin network to improve our predictions. As a bonus, we try this on predicting Ethereum's price.
